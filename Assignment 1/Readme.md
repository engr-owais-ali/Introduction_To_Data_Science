## Assignment Description

### Question 1

**Skill Tested:** Python Function Writing and Dictionary Manipulation

Write a Python function called `proportion_of_education` that calculates the proportion of children in the dataset who had a mother with different levels of education. The function should take no arguments and should return a dictionary containing the proportions in the form of:

```
{"less than high school":0.2,
"high school":0.4,
"more than high school but not college":0.2,
"college":0.2}
```

### Question 2

**Skill Tested:** Data Analysis and Basic Statistics

Explore the relationship between being fed breastmilk as a child and getting a seasonal influenza vaccine from a healthcare provider. Write a function that returns a tuple of the average number of influenza vaccines for those children who received breastmilk as a child and those who did not, in the form:

```
(2.5, 0.1)
```

### Question 3

**Skill Tested:** Data Analysis and Basic Statistics

Investigate if there is a link between vaccine effectiveness and sex of the child by calculating the ratio of the number of children who contracted chickenpox but were vaccinated against it (at least one varicella dose) versus those who were vaccinated but did not contract chickenpox. The function should return a dictionary containing the results by sex in the form:

```
{"male":0.2,
"female":0.4}
```

### Question 4

**Skill Tested:** Data Analysis and Basic Statistics

Determine if there is a correlation between having had the chickenpox and the number of chickenpox vaccine doses given (varicella). The function should return the correlation coefficient and p-value in the form of a tuple. Interpretation of the correlation coefficient and p-value is also provided in the question description.
